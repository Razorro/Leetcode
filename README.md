# Leetcode Problems
*When I'm free, just get some fun with LeetCode!* 

When the more problems are solved, the feeling about programming is getting stronger, that
a practical problem can be abstractly describle in several question model, we should observe them first, and then use 
programming language to describle our solutions. That means, observation really need to be weighted considerably.

Leetcode can practise the ability of observation, solution description ability, but,
in practical, problems don't have a clear boundary, so still need to use other method to practise the ability about thinking 
in macro perspective, that is so called architecture ability, do something that deal with some practical problems or read about
elegent open source are kinda of good methods.
