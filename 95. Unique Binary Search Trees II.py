"""
Given an integer n, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n.

Example:

Input: 3
Output:
[
  [1,null,3,2],
  [3,2,null,1],
  [3,1,null,null,2],
  [2,1,3],
  [1,null,2,null,3]
]
Explanation:
The above output corresponds to the 5 unique BST's shown below:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3


Get stuck again. I guess when the divide-and-conquer questions get complicated, I cannot make the
question in a clear way.
Most the situations I use divide and conquer, it's for advancing or backtracking from the last layer
function call, but this kind of problems, you must divide, and then conquer, with last step of combination,
things nailed. So, I still not get very well about those two kind of recursion.

For more detail about this topic, see CLRS "4.1 The maximum-subarray problem"
The core is, can you split the problems into same subprobmes, if does, just use the DaC to get the
answer.
